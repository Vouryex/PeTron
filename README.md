# PeTron
PeTron is greatly inspired by the classic game Tron which was released back in the 1980’s. The game’s basic gameplay consists of two light cycles that leave a light trail in order to cut each other's path and destroy its opponent. Additional power-ups are included in the game bringing a little bit of unique taste to its gameplay.
